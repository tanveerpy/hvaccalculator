                In terms of energy efficiency, a window is essentially a "thermal hole" in your wall. Even the best
                window is 10 times less efficient than a solid wall.
            </p>

            <p>
                When calculating <strong>how windows affect hvac load</strong>, we aren't just looking at the size of
                the glass. We have to analyze two critical ratings: U-Factor and SHGC.

                <p class="text-blue-800 mb-4">A single West-facing window can add as much heat as an entire room. </p>

            </div>

            <h2>The Two Ratings: U-Factor vs. SHGC</h2>
            <p>
                If you look at the NFRC sticker on a new window, you'll see these two numbers. They affect <strong>hvac
                    load calculation windows</strong> differently.
            </p>

            <h3>1. U-Factor (Conductive Heat Transfer)</h3>
            <p>
                This measures how well the window insulates.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li><strong>Low U-Factor (e.g., 0.25)</strong> is good. It keeps heat inside during winter.</li>
                <li><strong>High U-Factor (e.g., 1.20)</strong> is bad. This is single-pane glass.</li>
                <li><strong>Window u factor manual j</strong> impact: Crucial for <em>Heating Load</em> in cold
                    climates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient)</h3>
            <p>
                This measures how much solar radiation passes through the glass.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li><strong>SHGC 0.75 (Clear Glass):</strong> 75% of the sun's heat comes in.</li>
                <li><strong>SHGC 0.25 (Low-E Glass):</strong> Only 25% of heat enters.</li>
                <li><strong>Window shgc hvac</strong> impact: Crucial for <em>Cooling Load</em> in hot climates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The "Greenhouse Effect" on your AC</h2>
            <p>
                Solar heat is different from ambient heat. It travels as radiation, passes through the glass, hits your
                carpet/furniture, and turns into heat. This heat is trapped inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Replacing old clear glass with <strong>low e windows hvac sizing</strong> can drop your cooling load by
                20-30%, potentially allowing you to buy a smaller air conditioner.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Orientation is Critical</h2>
            <p>
                Not all windows are created equal. In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun's path makes <strong>window
                    orientation cooling load</strong> vary wildly.
            </p>

            <h3>The West vs North Rule</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>North Facing:</strong> Gets almost no direct sunlight. Acts as a shade. Low cooling load.
                <br>
                <strong>West Facing:</strong> Gets pounded by the low afternoon sun right at the hottest part of the day
                (4 PM - 7 PM).
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>A 50 sq ft window facing West adds 3x more load than the same window facing North.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why our calculator asks you to input window area by direction. If you just sum them all up, you
                miss the peak load spike caused by the Western exposure.
            </p>

            <h2>Do Curtains and Blinds Help?</h2>
            <p>
                Homeowners often ask if white blinds count as "shading."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Verdict: Only slightly.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the heat is inside the glass, it's inside the house. Blinds might reflect some back out, but the
                glass itself gets hot and radiates heat inward. Exterior shading (solar screens, awnings, trees) is 5x
                more effective than interior blinds.
            </p>

            <h2>Beyond the Glass: Air Leaks</h2>
            <p>
                Windows are also a common source of infiltration—air leaking in around the frame. This isn't reliable
                solar gain; it's uncontrolled draftiness.
