            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to HVACCalc. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy
                explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you visit our website.</p>

            <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not require you to create an account to use our calculator. We
                generally do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) like names or emails unless you

            <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may automatically collect information about how the website is accessed

                tool.</p>
            <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Our calculator uses your browser's Local Storage to temporarily save your
                inputs (e.g., floor area, state) so you don't lose work if you refresh. This data remains on your device
                and is not transmitted to our servers for permanent storage.</p>
